# Tempo

Tempo is an Android application designed to help deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals overcome speech impediments. It analyzes speech using the Google Speedch-to-Text API and provides the user with real-time feedback to encourage corrective action. Tempo also calculates a score out of 100 for the user based on multiple variables.

## Usage

```bash
./gradlew build
```
For immediate testing or debugging, build and install on a device or emulator using


```bash
./gradlew installDebug
```

Upon launching the app, tap the "play" button and begin speaking.
